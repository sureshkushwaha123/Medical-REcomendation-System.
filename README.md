# Medical-REcomendation-System.
This project aims to develop a smart and user-friendly medical recommendation system powered by machine learning. Users input their symptoms, and the system predicts potential diseases. It then provides personalized advice on medications and preventative measures. 

Disease Prediction from Symptoms:
Users can input one or more symptoms, and the system uses a trained ML model to predict the most likely disease with high accuracy.
